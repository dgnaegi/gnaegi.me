                <p>
                    There are some additional commands for further settings. By sending <code>/de</code> respectively <code>/en</code>, you can change your contact language. Furthermore, sometimes further notifications will be sent to you about the service. You can deactivate that by sending <code>/stop_spam</code>, but this comes with the chance that you're going to miss relevant information.
